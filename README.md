## 🔴🟠🟡🟢🔵🟣funcWave, html function renderer.
Originaly made from a school project to *renderer Sinus and Cosinus Mathematical functions* with some RGB effect, but I noticed that *I can renderer all the functions which VS Code supports*, so there are **40 functions** that you can test how you want. Combine and color them, use your creativity!

### You can choose from 10 different themes! \(￣︶￣*\))
- Rainbow (default) 🌈
- Aqua 🌊
- Orange 🍊
- Hades 💎
- Gummyworm 🐛
- Seaside ⛱
- Urban 🔩
- Ozone 🌏
- Galactica 🌌
- Sunset Lavender 🌅

## Usage of funcWave 🌊
When you open up the page you will find a few buttons on the top such as `Themes,  About, Functions`.
- About 📑: You will get some informations how to get started.
- Functions 📊: When pressing this button on the navbar you will make the Function Bar appear on the right side of the screen. You can combine and select any functions that you want.
- Themes 📕: I made 10 different themes to make the functions look cooler, there will be an update for themes. *(Check down bellow)*
  
## Incoming updates 🧩
I've been thinking about creating a more editor like interface where you can zoom, outzoom, etc.
There is also an idea to allow the user to create their own themes.
> There will be a few bug fixes as well, for example, there are 41 functions, *but 40 functional only*, cuz one is not an actual function.
 
## Recording from the runtime 🎥
*A few function combined with the Hades theme.*
