🔴🟠🟡🟢🔵🟣funcWave is originaly made from a school project to renderer Sinus and Cosinus Mathematical functions with some RGB effect, but I noticed that I can renderer all the functions which VS Code supports, so there are 40 functions that you can test how you want. Combine and color them, use your creativity!
