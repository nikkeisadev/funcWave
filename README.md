## 🔴🟠🟡🟢🔵🟣funcWave, html function renderer.
Originaly made from a school project to *renderer Sinus and Cosinus Mathematical functions* with some RGB effect, but I noticed that *I can renderer all the functions which VS Code supports*, so there are **40 functions** that you can test how you want. Combine and color them, use your creativity!

### You can choose from 10 different themes! \(￣︶￣*\))
- Rainbow (default) 🌈
- Aqua 🌊
- Orange 🍊
- Hades 💎
- Gummyworm 🐛
- Seaside ⛱
- Urban 🔩
- Ozone 🌏
- Galactica 🌌
- Sunset Lavender 🌅
- 
## Incoming updates 🧩
I've been thinking about creating a more editor like infterface where you can zoom, outzoom, etc.
There is also an idea to allow the user to create their own themes.
> There will be a few bug fixes as well, for example, there are 41 functions, but 40 functional only, cuz one is not an actual function.
 
## Recording from the runtime 🎥
*A few function combined with the Hades theme.*
